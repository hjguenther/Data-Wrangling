## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix in order to prevent 
## the costly need to compute it repeatedly 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned 
## by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
