# Getting and Cleaning-Data - Course Project
This project, as a part of Getting and Cleaning Data Course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera, combines a data set and presents it as a modified tidy data set.

The CodeBook.md file describes the source of the data set, what was executed to combine the data and transform it into a tidy data set, and a descriptions of the variables in the final ouptut (tidy.txt) of the R source code Run_analysis.R

The Run_analysis.R file takes the datasets from the source, combines them, filters for certain variables, performs manipulations, and creates one tidy data table. The data table returns only the variables that contain mean and standard devation, and lists the averages of these varibales for each class of activity, for each subject.
